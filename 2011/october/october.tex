\section{\texorpdfstring{October \emph{M2} / \emph{Kavkna
Jama}}{October M2 / Kavkna Jama}}

A weekend trip with the JSPDT in October to \emph{M2}/\emph{Kavkna Jama}
brought back 245 m of survey data from discoveries over 2009-2011,
adding 100 m of depth to \emph{M2} and bringing the closest approach
between \emph{Vrtnarija} and \emph{Kavkna Jama} to 4 m (with a +- 30 m
estimated error of the 1.4 km unclosed loop). The lead ends at an easily
dug mud floored bedding plane, leading off into a tight rift, with an
extremely strong draught. The trend of the cave passage is Northerly,
towards the Captain Kangaroo area of \emph{Vrtnarija}. Even if \emph{M2}
misses the closest point, Dark Tranquillity, it is hoped that it will
intersect another of the Captain Kangaroo shaft series at this depth
(\emph{Olympic Rift}, \emph{Dangermouse}).
