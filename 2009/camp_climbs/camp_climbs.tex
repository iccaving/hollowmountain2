\subsection{Climbs near Camp}

`\emph{Metal Aven}' (C+30 m) still has places left to scale, but appears
from the survey to reconnect to an earlier part in the fault (we
believe) controlled cave development in this region.

`\emph{KETI}' (C+23 m) consisted of an extremely exposed climb (across a
65 m pitch) to gain a rift jammed with unstable boulders which were
traversed to eventually realise a non-human sized connection to a low
part of \emph{Metal Aven}. We had hoped that this rift would trend
South, towards \emph{M2}, but instead almost immediately doubled-back on
itself in a North-East direction.

`\emph{Ride the Lightning}' (C+16 m), a climb of the twin shaft to
\emph{Kill'em All} pitch, gained a small section of passage which ended
at a pitch, estimated as being 30 m deep. Lack of gear and time
prevented its exploration, though the survey indicates it may be in the
vicinity of the bottom of \emph{Dangermouse} (2009, P52 m), and may yet
hold the key to bypassing the immature and unpassably small rift which
the \emph{Dangermouse} water disappeared down.
