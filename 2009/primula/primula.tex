\section{\texorpdfstring{Climbing
\emph{Primula}}{Climbing Primula}}

James KP and I decided to go camping to \emph{Metal Camp}. I was really
excited to return back to \emph{Captain Kangaroo}, as I have been going
down there for the last 2 years. We quickly arrived to the camp, where
Dan and Jana were resting. We repacked and took what we needed for our
climb. Our plan was to go and push above \emph{Primula}.

At the first rebelay in ``Kill Em All'' pitch, you take the rope up
which leads through meander and then there is a pitch. We descended to
the first ledge, not far down. Here we wanted to make a traverse to the
bolder choke. First we try it with a drill, but it didn't work. Secondly
we try hand bolted it. But because the rock was so bad, we on the end
decided to put a couple of slings around some naturals, to secure James
for the climb. When he reached the bolder choke he quickly put in one
bolt, as he did not trust the boulders above him. After couple of hours
trying to climb through, we then gave up and returned to camp. There
James prepared some food. Don't ask me what we eat, as far as I remember
he boiled some water and then throw in whatever he could find.
