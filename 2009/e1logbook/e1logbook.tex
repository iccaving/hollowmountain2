\section{Capping in E1}

    \margininbox{13.08.09 - Izi, Dan, Jarv}{
Took 27 caps. Used them all. A lot were double or bust, but still around 18 shot holes around 15 centimetres deep, using only a third of the 7.5 Ah SLA battery (24V with the Bosch). Blew a lot of rock. Surveyed out, around 30 m deep.

\subsection{Logbook - 14/08/09}

Back with Gergely -- two more caps some hammer \& chisel action \& we
were through! Placed a rawl (stainless) for pitch.

New chamber is 23 m with 4 m climb into prior discovered stuff.

Rubble on floor -- dug for $\approx$ 10'.

Got to bedrock.

No better nor worst than capped pitch, but not the stunning lead we were hoping for.
