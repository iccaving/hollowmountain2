After \emph{Primula} mission we still had time, so we decided to check
out Jarv's lead in ``Kill Em All''.

In the middle of the \emph{Kill'em All} pitch Jarv made a traverse to a
ledge. Here is a climb, so we decided to give it a go. This ledge is
small and just about fitted all 4 of us.

I decided to try the climb first. I attached the rope to myself and
started climbing. Meanwhile Erik was connected to that rope in case I
would fell on the ledge but miss it and start falling down the pitch. On
the top I bolted and use a natural for a backup. From here I could see a
pitch and others came up as well. We did not have enough rope to reach
the bottom so we left it undescended. We named this climb \emph{Ride the
Lightning}.
