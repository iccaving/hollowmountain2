\emph{K.E.T.I.}}{Climbing K.E.T.I.}}

The climb in \emph{Primula} did not give me a peace and I really wanted
to do it. I convinced Erik, Tja≈°a and Karin. For them this was the first
time down Captain and I was explaining the stories from previous years.
We quickly arrived to traverse that James and I were trying to do. First
I tried to go through the bolder choke, and then I send Erik to give it
a go. We decided it is too risky and instead did a climb up to a window
before the choke to bypass it. It was about 4 m to this window and we
could see a rocky spike so we tried to catch it with a lasso. After a
few attempts we made it and Erik went up first and secures the rope
properly. I followed up and after few meters upwards we realised, it
will not bypass the choke but we were curious where it leads. We were
stopped by a very tight squeeze, as none of us could fit through. But we
could see a big chamber through. We decided to throw a note with the
name K.E.T.I. written on it, so if anyone will arrive to this chamber
they will know that \emph{Primula} is on the other side. At this point
we heard the voices and started shouting. It was Thara and Tim. We asked
them, if they can see the note and where exactly are they. After
laughing, they said they are in \emph{Metal camp}. That tells us, that
there is another way to \emph{Primula} without going through
\emph{Kill'em All} pitch. We surveyed back to \emph{Primula}.
