\section{Outlook for 2010}

Five Major leads still going deep in \emph{Vrtnarija} at the end of 2009
-- two large phreatics separated by 120 m and heading in opposite
directions (\emph{Leopard} -539 m, \emph{Muddy Window} -529 m), two
large active pitch series (\emph{Tolminska Korita} -585 m, Republika
-737 m) and the rather tight \emph{Falls Road} (-577 m).

In \emph{Captain Kangaroo} we have the aforementioned \emph{Ride the
Lightning} pitch to drop, as well as a multitude of narrow rifts which
require expansion to pass at -190 to -270 m.
