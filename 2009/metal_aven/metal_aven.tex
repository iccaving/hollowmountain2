\section{\texorpdfstring{Climbing \emph{Metal
aven}}{Climbing Metal aven}}

When we woke up we felt a bit lazy, so we were wondering what to do; go
out or push a bit more. A plan was made to climb here, directly above
the tent. First 20 m I manage to free climb it; in the meanwhile James
went for the rope. When he returned, he throws me the rope and I secured
it around a big boulder. After that he came up and joined me. The last
10 m was James's turn to climb. Again we secured the rope with couple of
slings around some naturals in case of a fall and James made it to the
top. There he put in some bolts. On the top there was a tunnel, which we
crolled for a while, but then decided it is time to go back and survey.
We named this climb \emph{Metal aven}. After entering data into the
Survex, we discovered that looks like the tunnel is leading to Danger
Mouse pitch, which is just before the camp.
