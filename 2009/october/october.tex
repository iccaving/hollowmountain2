\subsection{October 2009}

A small JSPDT/ICCC team returned to \emph{M2} on a weekend in October.
Chemical persuasion was used to open the terminal rift in the floor,
leading to another small chamber. The phreatic passage further on from
the 2008 climb was dug out and extended to a point estimated at 30 m
from the base of the pitch which marked the end of exploration in 2008.
The wet pitches were derigged on the way out and the cave was left till
summer 2010.
