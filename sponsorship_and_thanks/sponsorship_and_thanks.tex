\chapter{Sponsorships and thanks}
We cannot thank enough the following organisations who have supported the Migovec expeditions over the years, and in particular from 2007 to 2012.
\begin{citemize}
\item The \textsc{PD Tolmin} and the \textsc{Triglavski
Narodni Park} (TNP) for continued support and permission to organise the
summer cave exploration camp on \passage[mountain]{Tolminski Migovec}.
\item The \textsc{Ghar Parau Foundation} for the \textsc{Ghar Parau Expedition Grant Award}, which provided funds for buying all kinds of equipment -- and its subset, the \textsc{Alex Pitcher Award} which helped young cavers buy their caving helmets and lights and allowed them into expedition caving. This ongoing support played a pivotal role in promoting a thriving club community.
\item \textsc{Beast Products} for their sponsorship and donation of thermals for underground camp in 2009, which were put to use again and again in the following years and without which a good night's sleep underground would have been much less likely.
\item The \textsc{Imperial College Trust} and  \textsc{Imperial College Union} for Tours funding (Recreational
Clubs Committee) for the financial support directed at transportation subsidy.

\item The 2010 and 2012\textsc{Viljem Putick Prize} awarded for best Slovenian exploration project, put to good use in the purchase of additional rigging equipment.

\item \textsc{Felix}, the Imperial College weekly newspaper for the publication of exploration stories.

\item All the editors of this volume of the Hollow Mountain, more than a decade in the making - \textit{Jarvist Frost} for starting it all, \textit{Ben Richards} for getting it going again, \textit{Tanguy Racine} for providing the template from the excellent Hollow Mountain 3, which this volume merely emulates. 

\item All photographers and authors who contributed to this project, and particularly to those who meticulously labelled their photographs - \textit{Jarvist Frost}, \textit{Jana Čarga}, and \textit{Iztok Možir}. A special thanks goes to to \textit{Tharatorn Supasiti} as the only cartoonist in this volume.

\item Tony Seddon and \textsc{Starless River} for supplying expedition equipment (often with a large discount), rope rescue practice sessions held in the UK, and general advice on everything expeditionary.

\item Mark and Jim Evans, for starting it all for ICCC, and for coming back often to share stories of early exploration at the sunset spot.
\item The old lags who return to Slovenia year after year to explore cave passage and share their knowledge.
\item James 'Tetley' Hooper, for the use of his flat in Tolmin as a base throughout 2007--2012.
\item Janet Cotter, for doing a million tasks in the Bivi and years of surface bashing work. 
\item Dave Wilson, for the design and sale of many Bisun lights (nee Mig lights) to new cavers, and for the technical expertise in setting up the solar panel electronics, on which the expedition depends.


\item Jarvist Frost again for the colossal amount of work dedicated to Migovec the Hollow Mountain project, and every word and Git command that forms the basis of this book. 


\item The \textit{Klobu\v{c}ar} family: Slavica, Marjan, Nada, Zoran\ldots{} for the generous use of the barn to store equipment and park the van during the expeditions.

\item Our friends at the JSPDT, with whom we've shared the toil and the rewards under Migovec.
\item The \textsc{Jamarska Re\v{s}evalna Slu\v{z}ba} (JRS), the \textsc{Jamarska zveza Slovenije} (JZS) whithin which it operates, the helicopter pilot from mountain rescue services whom we must thank again.
\item \textit{Zdenko Rejec}, for heading the JSPDT and being so supportive. Hvala!
\item \textit{Jana \v{C}arga} for the work behind the scenes within the JSPDT, for translating Slovenian to English and vice versa over and over, and for every photograph.
\item \textit{Andrej Fratnik}, whose welcoming spirit sparked this joint venture and whose participation in the project from the very early start to this day has never faltered.
