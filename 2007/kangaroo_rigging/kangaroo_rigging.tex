\section{Riggin' Captain Kangaroo}

First trip was with Thara. Tet had already rigged down Pico (re-bolting
it in the process), so we set off for that familiar window with a
bolting hammer, a hundred metres of rope and a couple of cinnamon malt
loaves. Had the same trouble finding Tet's single bolt as I'd had in
2005. However, instead of bottling it, I placed two new spitz, this time
within sensible reach for easy rigging. A hundred metres of rope got us
to Traverse Chamber, cursing and kicking the heavy bag all the way
through Scrotty.

Sandeep was the next victim, this time we set off with a hundred and
fifty metres of rope. We rigged down to Olympic Rift, stopping on the
way to chisel open an awkward squeeze. We left thirty metres of rope in
a tacklesac at the start of Olympic Rift and did some re-bolting on the
last two pitches. Also left three hangers and maillons, ten spits \&
cones, two karabiners, a chisel and two slings. At this stage the
squeeze and huge black space the other side at the end of Olympic rift
seemed like the best lead in Captain Kangaroo.

A bounce to Pico with James gave me the chance to do some more work on
the entrance to Captain Kangaroo. I put in a tensioned traverse which
removed the `traditional' rub-point at the start of the take off.
