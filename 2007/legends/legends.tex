\section{Our Faces Are Legends}

The filthy Union filched a photo from our website to deface their buses with! As part of their 'rebranding' exercise, in their infinite wisdom they've decided on the utterly dotty plan of having the new minibuses with
custom full-colour printed panels. This will make it approximately three times more expensive to repair any
bodywork. Nice one!

And on one of the minibuses
(which I am sure they will not
hire to us for at least 5 years,
when it's been properly driven
into the ground), the photo
they choose is of us staring
blearily at the fire in Slovenia.

Now I wonder how many Union rules we're breaking in that one photo?

Personally I'm flattered – just
don't expect me to write a risk
assessment for the Bivi...
