\chapter{2007}
\textit{Absolutely} stonking year, very lucky with the weather, lots of
interesting developments. No accidents, no missed call outs and
generally a very smoothly run, pleasant and safe expedition

\passage{Gardeners' World}, \passage{Captain Kangaroo}, pushed to within 28 m of the lower \passage{M2} 1980s JSPDT survey. There is a possibility that we are unknowingly connected (Slovs did not use PSSs in the 1970s except for a red paint splodge at the bottom of Silos), and a probability that a connection exists. This will be a major target for 2008, with the possibility mooted of rigging down \passage{M2}.

Combined these would now be 11493 m + 5229 m = 16722 m = 2nd longest in Slovenia
