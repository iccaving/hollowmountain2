\chapter{2007 - The Final Nameless Expo}
An absolutely stonking year! We were very lucky with the weather, together with lots of interesting developments. No accidents, no missed call outs and generally a very smoothly run, pleasant and safe expedition.

\passage{Gardeners' World}, \passage{Captain Kangaroo}, was pushed to within 28 m of the lower \passage{M2} 1980s JSPDT survey. There is a possibility that we are unknowingly connected as the Slovenes did not use PSSs in the 1970s except for a red paint splodge at the bottom of \passage{Silos}, and there's a probability that a connection exists. This will be a major target for 2008, with the possibility mooted of rigging down \passage{M2}.

Combined these two cave systems would now be 11493 m + 5229 m = 16722 m - the second longest system in Slovenia\ldots{}
