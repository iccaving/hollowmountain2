\section{Super Action}


In October 2012, on the annual ICCC/JSPDT ¡winter action¢ weekend, a
breakthrough was made in \passage{Primadona}, another cave system on
mountain. Due to its close proximity to the System, this will be the
next big connection project in our bid to shed more light on the complex
subterranean system under \passage{Migovec}.
