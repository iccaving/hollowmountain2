\section{Surface Work}

Aided by perfect weather for much of the expedition, surface work was
carried out by cavers in between underground camps. Most of it was
concentrated in Areas K and N. Two pitches were dropped in \passage{N9} (\passage{Kuk Pot}),
with the continuation visible but hampered by a lack of time.

Entrances \passage{K2}, \passage{K6}, \passage{K11}, \passage{K22}, \passage{K21}, \passage{K23}, \passage{K24}, \passage{K25}, and \passage{K26} were also
revisited. \passage{K22}, \passage{K24}, \passage{K25} did not seem at all promising. Good progress
was made digging \passage{K6}. Of the remainder, \passage{K2} seems to have the most
potential, though all need a lot of work before the cave goes.
