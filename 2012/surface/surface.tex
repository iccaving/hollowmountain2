\section{Surface Work}

Aided by perfect weather for much of the expedition, surface work was
carried out by cavers in between underground camps. Most of it was
concentrated in Areas K and N. Two pitches were dropped in N9 (Kuk Pot),
with the continuation visible but hampered by a lack of time.

Entrances K2, K6, K11, K22, K21, K23, K24, K25, and K26 were also
revisited. K22, K24, K25 did not seem at all promising. Good progress
was made digging K6. Of the remainder, K2 seems to have the most
potential, though all need a lot of work before the cave ¡goes¢.
