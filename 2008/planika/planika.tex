\emph{Planika}}{26/7 Jarv \& Clew → Planika}}

Ill fated trip! The rerig slowed us down. Clew placed a Y-hang bolt -
went a bit deep, no matter - ``I have a cunning plan''. Wedging a spare
cone lightly into the spit, he protected the thread while cleaning
around. Of course, it didn't come out again. Then he hit a super tight
Alpine-butterfly just 1 m shy of the rebelay. 20 mins of effort, to
prussic up \& have Jarv knaw it open. Then he lost his knife in a
crevass \& spent 20 thoroughly cold minutes digging it out, while Jarv
placed the backup bolt (nice white soft rock). Expanded the chest
squeeze \& finally reached the pushing front rather late. Clew expanded
the pre-pitch squeeze while Jarv rerigged \& then attempted the higher,
better rift.

Rift: Phreatic top slightly less than body crawl sized tube, less than
chest width vadose. But transition zone is very friable. I got
\textasciitilde3 m in, to see 2 m rift → chamber. Drafting \emph{IN}.
Chamber has fist sized boulders in it. Turns right.

GOING!!! ( with instrument of destruction) Jarv
