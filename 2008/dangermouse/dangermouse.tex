With a load of food \& bolts, we shot down to Something Fishy \& dived
down the right crawl. Drafting, with deep sand floor (all spoiled!).
Became rather tight after \textasciitilde7 m.

So we hit the pitch, belay off jammed boulder, soon with a bolt.

Paul \& Izi set off to grab the 2nd bolt kit. Hopped down 2nd pitch (6
m) and came to something seemingly identical. Rigged off obvious natural
\& dropped down to choosy shelf \textasciitilde8 m. Then I turned
around. Small pitch it was not. Boulders banged for 6s+. Water could be
heard a long way down, nothing visible {[}not even a drip!{]}. The way
to the \emph{M2} confluence?

From -25 m (limit), one could peer down past cascades into\ldots{}
blackness. Big chamber?

Left \textasciitilde50 m of 10 mm at last bolt, PSS on sticking-out
ledge + bolt kit. \& 2nd bolt kit at head of Something Fishy.

Early exit \textasciitilde1AM.

We blew trumpets every hour \& listened every x 30 minutes - nothing
from the \emph{M2} crew.
