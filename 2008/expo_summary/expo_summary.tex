\section{Exploration Summary}

In summary, Migovec now has three major systems and over a dozen smaller
caves in active exploration. The exploration in \emph{Vrtnarija} was at
the very end of our endurance limits - the minimal trip length to
achieve anything was 15hrs. Our plans are to camp down there in 2009 in
order to have far more man hours at the `coal face' and to offer the
psychological and physiological refuge of a camp in a location that, in
spite of its relatively shallow depth, is truly a long way from a safe
place.

The mountain is unique in having such complicated Alpine cave formation
at various depths, and now constitutes 21.988 km of passage beneath just
a square kilometre of surface.

Everything newly explored was surveyed to BCRA Grade 4b, underground
photography as part of documentation took place in \emph{Vrtnarija}, E1,
\emph{Plopzilla} (Sistem Mig) and \emph{Planika}. We were limited by
there being only one underground photographer on the expedition.

A new survey on an East-West projection has been drawn of \emph{M2} and
\emph{Vrtnarija}.
