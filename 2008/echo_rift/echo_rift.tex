Straight to echo rift \& started hammering (no lump, only bolt hammer).
4hrs later w/ Bob Dylan blaring, after a few tries with oversuit I
stripped to wet socks, furry \& safety hat (acrylic). I got my feet into
the chamber beyond up to my feet, but couldn't commit to not breathing
as I pushed past.

You know it's desperate when your wet socks freeze to the ground as you
get ready.

Problem is the S-bend nature of the rift. And my refusal to go
headfirst.

On way out, we derigged to first rebelay \& climbed into scary rift:
\passage{``Diggers of the U.G.''}. Loose boulders everywhere, above extension
Meander which forms lowest rebelay. BUT, off to the left is a strongly
blowing chamber through tight, but hammerable , rift.
