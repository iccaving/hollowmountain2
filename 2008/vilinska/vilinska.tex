\section{Vilinska Jama AKA Tetley's mysterious lead}

Tetley led the way down past \passage{Gardeners' World}, only grudgingly agreeing that blindfolds would not be required. The entrance is an unwelcoming yet
strangely inviting scree slope under a bedding plane, with a howling and
glacial draft emerging from it.

We headed down, leaving Janet at the surface to see off any would-be
unsurpers of the joys within. The way on quickly opens up to a chamber
with a snow plug then regresses just as quickly to a tight, boulder
filled, rift. Tetley started chiselling away at a constriction. Dan took
over while Tetley dug underneath, bypassing the squeeze entriely. More
up \& down around the boulders led to an impassably tight pitch head.
Tetley \& Dan made slow progress with chisels until Bozo arrived, having
extracted our location from Janet. A few mighty blows later, the way on
was clear (still tight though - will need more destruction).

Tetley rigged a ladder from a securely wedged boulder, and Dan clambered
down into a boulder strewn chamber. Water was dripping from a crack in
the ceiling, and the rift continued ahead. 

``Does it go?'' shouted
Tetley. 

``Game on!'' came the reply.

Bozo forged ahead, quickly finding another chamber, filled with a vast
two way boulder slope. Up and over choked quickly. Down and under was
precarious in the extreme, but Tetley's careful progress under the
hanging death and down a short climb yielded the next pitch. A
$\approx$ 20 m drop into a large fault controlled chamber. With no
SRT kit or rope we made our exit, pausing briefly to discuss potential
names. We settled on \passage{Vilinksa Jama} (Veela cave) and returned to the \passage{Bivi}
for Tea \& Medals.
