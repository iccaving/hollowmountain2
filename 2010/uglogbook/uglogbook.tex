\fullwidthbox{Setting up Camp \emph{X-Ray}}{
After about 6 hours of caving in \emph{Vrtnarija}, we finally made it down. 
We met Gergely and James on the way down just as they were exiting the cave. The last bolt on \emph{Zimmer} before camp is horrible: it needs rebolting and rerigging. 
15 cm lower would be awesome. 

We set up the tent at the camp, which required some stone movement. 
Mike got water from nearby \emph{Zimmer} and Jarv and I built up the tent, while Kate was smoking. 
NEED WEED! We should have thought about it beforehand. 
Now listening to Massive Attack and getting Raptured. Oh yeah! 

Kate is now setting up sleeping space, while Jarv is away to get more water.

Camp is slowly getting established, we're now looking forward to Worms World Party. 
Mike is cooking. 
Weed is really a missing resource. 
So far so good. 
About 5 metres from camp is a hole with audible rush of water in it. This quickly got established as peeing corner, hoping it's not a lead...

23/7/10 Nice snooze - super warm. Nicola snored like a trooper - just a
few minutes into the classic Black Adder session. Broken sleep -
particularly as Nicola got up for X2 piss. Awoken at 10.30 am by the
beasts crawling up towards our pits. Tetley \& Myles rustled up some
hot-choc then wandered off down the continuing passage.

23.7.10 - 2:10pm MD + Tetley Entered Gardener's World
\textasciitilde 6.20 am. Made our way through, re-rigged \emph{Zimmer}
on the way. Arrived at camp at 10:30am + awakened Jarv, Mike, Kate and
Niko.

Wandered around \emph{Friendship Gallery} for hour or two. Found nice
lead, will investigate later. Sleep now.

23-7 2:20pm

It's good to be back in a sleeping bag at Camp \emph{X-Ray} - seven
years since the last camp here. It's very comfy. I like the tent - some
things don't change though, Blackadder on the sound system, smash + tuna
etc. Hopefully we'll get some good pushing in tomorrow! Tetley

23-7 6:20pm James and Dan arrive for a quick visit before heading off to
push the \emph{muddy window} 8:20pm Andy + Gergely arrive - I ignore
them! Tet

23-7 10:30pm Fucking body won't fall asleep! Must have only had couple
of hours at most since Dan arrived\ldots{} Gergei + Andy turned up at
8ish + now, they have checked our \emph{Leopard} a little. Tetley's
bodily functions are out of control! May bring some corks down for his
digestive tract next time. Anyway, now for some food + tea + hopefully
can stay awake till bedtime at noon! Myles.

23-7 11pm Myles and I share breakfast / dinner with Gergely + Andy. Fine
food! (Ed: Believe this was Tetley)

24-7 12:20 Breakfast with Tet \& Miles. Dan \& I will visit the lead we
killed yesterday (\emph{Muddy Window}) \& survey it, then to \emph{Red
Cow}. James K

24-7 1:30pm MD Back in Camp for 2nd night. Pushed Tolminka today, good
lead, surveyed \textasciitilde 8am. Some nice pitches. Covered in mud.
Listening to strange foreign music.

24-7 2:05pm Great push down Korita today - 8 bolts, surveying etc. IT'S
GOING GOING GOING\ldots{} GO THERE! (But try and avoid rigging future
pitches in or near the water\ldots{}) Andy + Gergely have left to push
\emph{Leopard} - James + Dan to survey \emph{Muddy Window} and then go
for a jolly below \emph{Big Rock Candy Mountain}. I've had a great day -
thanks Myles. Time for a decent seep. Tet

23:20 24/7/2010 James + Dan return on a high! 9 hrs good kip in bed - I
feel good! forgot to say I had a shit yesterday\ldots{}. Tet
