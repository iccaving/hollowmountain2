The JSPDT organised a trip based at the mountain hut at \passage{Kal} on 2nd
October 2010. The terminal rift was enlarged to gain a
\textasciitilde 20 m pitch and a larger, undescended (due to lack of rope), pitch.

A return trip three weeks later descended the pitch and found it to be
\(\approx\) 60 m. The cave closes immediately, with a tight rift taking
the water and a slightly larger abandoned rift also offering potential.
It draughts strongly.

The \passage{M2} cavers returned in thick fog, following their footsteps
through the 10 cm deep snow. With the coming winter Migovec is
effectively closed for exploration until summer 2011.
