\subsection{Vrtnarija Loop Closures}

Our survey is now corrected to grid north based on the NOAA American
Webservice, with Lat + Long on M10/Bivi, calculated for 1st Aug of each year.
This was mainly to agree with surface DEM data \& GPS data (declination is
approximately 2.5 degrees), as the rate of change of declination is slow (6
minutes a year).

\passage{Vrtnarija} possess two large loops, making the cave into a `figure 8' configuration. 

During 2009 the \passage{Captain Kangaroo} --- main pitch series loop was closed
(consisting of data collected from 2000--2009, approximately 1.8km loop).
During 2010 the \passage{Tolminska Korita} -- \passage{Big Rock} loop was closed (data from
2001--2010, approximately 1.7km loop).

All sampled misclosures were 1.5--2.0 \%. Typically the horizontal misclosure
was twice that of the vertical (our total plan length of survey polygon is also
approximately double the total vertical length).
