James and William. Pushed a wet, so far unnamed pitch off \passage{Prince Consort
Road}, could see what might have been the bottom about 10 m down at which
point the streamway really started to pour down (must be raining again).
Eventually bolted to the apparent bottom which of course wasn't, water
continued to hammer down a large hole in the floor, might have been a
challenge to rig and stay dry, but fortunately found a dry rift that
went over the active pitch (possibly). Another 40 m down that should be
easy to descend. \name{William French}}

After couple of days on the surface, I decided to do some camping with
my Slovenian mates. Tjaša, Erik, Mawer and I started to walk towards the
entrance of \passage{Vrtnarija} at around 2 am. We reached the camp too
early for our bed time
\sidenote{On the Night Train, the bed time is 8 am to 8 pm}, so we
decided to go and check out the crystals in \passage{Palace of King Minos}.
After this, we still had time so we decided to go and try digging in
\passage{Minotaur Rift}, where last time with Dan we could hear the
enticing `roar' of water. After couple of hours moving boulders with no
breakthrough, we returned to camp.


The next day we planned to investigate one lead in \passage{Palace of King
Minos}, that we had not yet pushed with Dan. The entrance to the lead
was quite narrow, but beyond it we reached a series of active water
pitches. We had enough rope to bolt two drops and decided to name the
passage \passage{Povodni Mož} \sidenote{Water nymph}, as we had been
following the water all the time.

Back again for my seventh night! Fratnik and I had a smooth 2hr journey
down. Met Nicholas and Thara just about to head out. Jarv and Myles are
here too (soon to go down \passage{Korita}). James and William then turned up. \bignote{TEA
all round!} Fratnik and I eventually went for a tourist jolly to the
\passage{Queen's Bed Chamber}. Then we went down to push \passage{Povodni Mož}. Wow! A small
hole in a large dry passage soon leads to small fossil stream passage
then to nice active stream. Went down 2 pitches (pushed by Izi, Erik,
Tjaša and Mawr). Bagged one more then half bolted another. Back to camp
for tea (and medals). It's clearly raining outside -- \passage{Zimmer} is
very wet. Hope Jarv and Myles (now back from pushing \passage{Korita}) make it out
OK!

The entire Vodna Sled 2010 Expedition for their plastic bag garden in \passage{Friendship Gallery}, in particular the 'loving cup' of the final compostable excrement binbag.

Special mention to Dan Greenwald for somehow summoning the courage to 'deal with it' and wrestling the many faeces into a Daren drum for sealing up and taking up to the surface for disposal.

"It wouldn't have been nearly so bad if people had been a little more consistent with their aim," remarked Dan when reminded of this entirely repressed memory. "One had to search really rather carefully for safe hand holds.

I have written a Haiku to try and exorcise those memories\ldots{}

Fratnik and I are back and well fed. A great day's caving. Sadly \passage{Povodni Mož} is now dead: Upstream pushed to 30 m+ aven; bolting downstream, we eventually hit a sump. All now surveyed and derigged. Now time for bed.
