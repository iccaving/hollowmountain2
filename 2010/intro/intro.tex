\chapter{2010 --- Vodna Sled}

Vodna Sled 2010 was a clear success - in all we discovered 2.2 km of new
passage, all below -500 m, all in \emph{Vrtnarija} using \emph{Camp
X-Ray} (\emph{Reloaded}, now a plush four bed camp at -550 m) as a base.

The major discovery was the swinging into the \textbf{Leopard} lead from
\emph{Zimmer} chamber, leading to a 1.5 km complex of mainly horizontal
passage (\textbf{Prince Consort Road}, \emph{Wonderland}), with many
unpushed leads for future years. Significant amounts of exploration also
took place in \emph{Tolminska Korita} concluding with a connection to
the deep level of \emph{Vrtnarija} (below \emph{Big Rock}) at -653 m,
and pushing the \emph{Republika} streamway from -744 to -802 m.
