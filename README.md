The reboot is finally happening. 

This repo is synced with Overleaf, so make edits there if you can to avoid the two becoming out of sync. Ask Ben if you want access but don't have it already.

Use this repo for searches, large changes or other things that are just easier to not do in Overleaf. Be sure to pull the changes into Overleaf afterwards.
